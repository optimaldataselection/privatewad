**Captions:** Data augmentation increases the dimensionality of raw data. We compare Wasserstein Distance (WD) calculations using: OTDD (blue line), augmented data (pink line), and augmented data without raw data sharing (green line, our method). The approximation error, introduced by the randomness of gamma, has a bounded error rate.
